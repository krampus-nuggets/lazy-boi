# Lazy Boi

A CLI for installing project templates for multiple libraries and frameworks

## Currently supported libraries/frameworks

- ReactJS
- VueJS

## Note The Following

1. Currently only tested on Windows OS, sooooooooo🤷🏽‍♂️
2. Templates that are installed are not from original providers they are specifically catered towards my programming/building style thus this projects in also customizable for your own style👨🏽‍🏭
3. Also, because of point 2 above packages can be outdated🤾🏽‍♂️
